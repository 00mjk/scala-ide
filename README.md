SBT support in Eclipse
======================

The purpose of this project is to provide good support for SBT projects using a multi step compilation task, like Play projects.

The initial goals are to enable importing vanilly SBT projects, driving the build process from Eclipse and provide an output console.

## Building:

This template uses [plugin-profiles](https://github.com/scala-ide/plugin-profiles) to manage the build. Check its documentation for detailed information. A script with good default parameters is provided:

    ./build.sh
